#Safari Prototype

Create a prototype for the Safari main combat gameplay.

##Goals of Prototype:

* Work out necessary data structures
* Discover pitfalls or challenges of structure
* Get an idea down on "paper" from which to brainstorm and progress
* Provide a concrete starting point that is a solid project to work on

##Steps to accomplish
*...and estimated time to completion*

###Phase 1: Prep

1. Create a server in Nodejs from which to run the game locally - 30min - 1hr
2. Investigate Pixi.js and its API. Become familiar enough to get started - 30min - 1hr
3. Code a Hexagonal gamespace grid. This grid class should implement the API described below - 5 - 10hr

###Phase 2: Game Characters / Combat Mechanics

1. Find avatar images for use as character standins - 30min
2. Map out the exact mechanics for proto-combat - 1 - 2hr
3. From the combat needs, write an API for a character class - 2 - 3hr
4. Implement the API for the character class, and design 10 test charcters: 5 for each side - 5 - 6hr

###Phase 3: Event Loop

1. Map out what actions take place when in the event loop - 1 - 2hr
2. Implement the event loop - 4 - 8hr
3. Refine event loop / combat mechanics. Correct to make it engaging / interesting - 4hr
4. Debug / testing buffer - 10hr
